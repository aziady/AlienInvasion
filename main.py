# In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
# The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
# spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down
# the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots al the aliens,
# a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's
# ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three
# ships, the game is over.
